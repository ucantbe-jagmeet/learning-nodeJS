/* 
why ? 

-> node is a built environment used in backend
-> node developer create API 
-> Node can make API for Web, Android, and IOS etc
-> it can also make website

Ques -> Is javascript and NodeJs is same ??
ANs -> 1. Js and NodeJs code syntax is same but both are not exactly same
       2. we can not connect javascript to Database
       3. NodeJs is run on server side but javascript is run on browser
